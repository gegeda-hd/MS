We provide the code implementation of an improved model based on LSGAN, which can use DBT 7-channel images as the model input images. 
By leveraging the generative adversarial network, it supplements the DM image features, which have less information,
with the tomographic features of the DBT images, which have more information, to generate DBT image features with richer lesion information. 
Compared with traditional generative adversarial networks, it generally yields more stable generation quality and better results. 
The classification effect on the benign and malignant based on the generated features is more accurate than that of the DM images.
